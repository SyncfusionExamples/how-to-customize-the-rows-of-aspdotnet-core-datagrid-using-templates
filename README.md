# How to Customize the Rows of ASP.NET Core DataGrid using Templates

A quick-start project that helps you to customize rows in the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core `DataGrid` using templates. Discover how to use `detail templates` to show additional information by expanding or collapsing grid rows.

* `Row Template`: Customizes the appearance of grid rows by defining a template that can include HTML and data-binding expressions. This allows you to create a personalized layout for each row.

* `Detail Template`: Provides a way to show additional information about a grid row in an expandable section. This template is revealed when a user expands a row, allowing for a detailed view of row data without cluttering the main grid layout.
